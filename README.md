Probability of livestock predation in relation to elevation and distance from the urban center of the best-fit generalized linear model
(GLM). Elevation and distance from the urban center were important predictors of the supported model. Areas far from the urban center and at high elevations are more likely to suffer losses to pumas because of the habitat suitability for the species [(Palmeira et al 2015).](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-015-0562-5)
