# Cattle depredation by puma and jaguar in central-western Brazil: Revisiting and improving a poor chart of an old manuscript

In this study, data on cattle depredation by puma (Puma concolor) and jaguar (Panthera onca) were recorded for six years (1998–2003) in a cattle ranch in central-western Brazil. Depredation represented 18.9% of the overall cattle mortality, being predominant on calves. Depredation was mainly associated with cattle’s age class and location along with the time of birth of calves. Depredation had a negative correlation with age of the killed animals (p < 0.05; rs = -0.80), being more frequent in newborns (0–2 months) and practically absent in calves older than 8 months (only nine animals above 12 months old). In order to reduce depredation, calves should be kept as far as possible from forest areas and concentrated cattle breeding and calving seasons should be encouraged [(Palmeira et al 2008).](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2007.09.015)

I have recreated the Figure 3 by displaying the 95% confidence interval bands, and also added the silhouette of a calf carcass.
